# Function-Analysis

The project is to build a software that is able to perform various analysis of a function. The software will be able to perform operations such as finding the expression for rate of change of the function and calculating its rate of change value at a provided value, calculate the integral expression of the function and hence calculating the integral value of the function by accepting limits. The software also has the potential to calculate the root of a given function using the Bisection method. The software can also obtain a linear fit and an exponential fit based on the userâ€™s choice; therefore, is also able to predict values for any provided point. The software enables user to select his/her choice of operations from the start menu from the given set of options. The user has the option for performing derivative analysis, integration, find root, and predicting outcomes using linear fit and exponential fit.
